# Live Captions and Live Translation for Meetings

> Turn calls, videos, and in-person conversations into live text you can actually work from.

## What this is for

Use this when the problem is comprehension first, not note-taking second:

- noisy calls
- weak microphones
- fast speakers
- accents you are still adapting to
- video walkthroughs you want to scan instead of replay

## Workflow

### Windows 11

1. Press `Win + Ctrl + L`, or go to `Settings > Accessibility > Captions`.
2. Turn on Live Captions.
3. Enable microphone input if you want captions from in-person conversation.

### macOS

1. Open `System Settings > Accessibility > Live Captions`.
2. Turn Live Captions on.
3. Keep the caption window visible during the call or video.

### Android

1. Open `Settings > Accessibility > Live Transcribe`.
2. Turn it on.
3. Grant microphone access.
4. Add the accessibility shortcut if you want to start it quickly.

### Live Translation

#### Windows 11

Windows Live Captions can translate spoken audio into English captions in real time:

1. Open `Settings > Accessibility > Captions > Live Captions`.
2. Click the gear icon in the caption bar and select the source language.
3. Captions will appear translated into English.

#### macOS

macOS Live Captions support translation for select language pairs:

1. Open `System Settings > Accessibility > Live Captions`.
2. Enable translation and choose the target language.

#### Limitations

- Translation is currently limited to English as a target language on most platforms.
- Quality degrades with fast speech, heavy accents, or multiple speakers.
- Not a replacement for professional interpretation in legal, medical, or compliance contexts.

### After the live session

If you need reusable notes, copy the visible text or use a recording and run Whisper afterward.

Prompt:

```text
Turn these captions into:
1. key points
2. decisions made
3. action items with owners
4. unclear items I should verify manually
```
