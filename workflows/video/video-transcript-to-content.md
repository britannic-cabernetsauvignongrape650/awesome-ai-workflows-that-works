# Video Transcript → Blog Post + Shorts + Chapters

> Recorded a tutorial or talk? Turn it into a blog post, chapter markers, and short-form clips with one prompt.

## What this is for

Video is rich content but poor in discoverability. Text is the opposite. This workflow extracts the transcript from any video, then uses Claude to generate all the derivative content — blog post, YouTube chapters, short-form clip scripts — in a single pass.

Works for: tutorials, conference talks, podcast episodes, webinar recordings, YouTube videos.

## Step 1: Get the Transcript

### Option A — Your own recording (local file)

You have two options for local transcription: **Whisper** (original OpenAI) or **faster-whisper** (recommended — up to 4x faster, lower memory usage, same accuracy).

#### Using faster-whisper (recommended)

```bash
# Install faster-whisper
pip install faster-whisper

# Transcribe — pick model and compute type based on your hardware (see table below)
faster-whisper my_video.mp4 --model medium --language en -o out.txt

# CPU-only (no NVIDIA GPU) — use int8 quantization:
faster-whisper my_video.mp4 --model base --compute_type int8 --language en -o out.txt

# NVIDIA GPU with FP16 support:
faster-whisper my_video.mp4 --model large-v3 --compute_type float16 --language en -o out.txt

# With timestamps (needed for chapter markers):
faster-whisper my_video.mp4 --model medium --language en -o out.srt
```

> See the [faster-whisper docs](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) for all options and supported compute types.

#### Using Whisper (original)

```bash
# Install Whisper
pip install openai-whisper

# Transcribe
whisper my_video.mp4 --model medium --output_format txt

# With timestamps:
whisper my_video.mp4 --model medium --output_format srt
```

> See the [Whisper docs](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for all options.

#### Choosing the right model and settings

Pick your model based on your hardware and quality needs:

| Model | Size | Speed | Quality | Best for |
|-------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `tiny` | 39MB | Very fast | Low | Quick draft, you'll edit heavily |
| `base` | 74MB | Fast | Decent | CPU-only machines, quick results |
| `medium` | 769MB | Moderate | Good | Most use cases, good balance |
| `large-v3` | 1.5GB | Slow | Best | Final content, technical vocab |

Pick your `--compute_type` (faster-whisper only) based on your hardware:

| Hardware | Recommended `--compute_type` | Notes |
|----------|------------------------------|-------|
| CPU only (Intel/AMD, no dedicated GPU) | `int8` | Fastest option on CPU, minimal quality loss |
| NVIDIA GPU (RTX 20xx+) | `float16` | Best speed/quality on modern GPUs |
| NVIDIA GPU (older / low VRAM) | `int8_float16` | Saves VRAM while keeping decent speed |
| Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) | `int8` | GPU acceleration not yet supported, use CPU |

> **Not sure?** Start with `--model base --compute_type int8` — it works everywhere. Upgrade to `medium` or `large-v3` if quality isn't good enough.

### Option B — YouTube video

```bash
# Install yt-dlp
pip install yt-dlp

# Download audio only
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" -o "video.mp3"

# Transcribe (use either one)
faster-whisper video.mp3 --model medium --language en -o out.txt
# or: whisper video.mp3 --model medium --output_format txt

# Or: just use YouTube's auto-generated captions
# YouTube Studio → Subtitles → Download → .srt
```

### Option C — Fireflies / Otter (for recorded meetings/webinars)

Both tools export transcripts directly. Download as `.txt` from their dashboard.

## Step 2: Generate All Content in One Pass (AI-Generated Text)

Paste your transcript into Claude with this prompt:

```
You are a content producer. I'm giving you a video transcript. Generate all of the following from it.

---

**A. YouTube Chapter Markers**
Format: MM:SS Title (keep each title under 40 characters)
Start at 00:00. Create a chapter every time the topic meaningfully shifts.
There should be 6-12 chapters for a 30-60 minute video.

**B. Blog Post**
Length: [target word count, e.g., 1500 words]
Rules:
- Preserve the speaker's voice and specific examples — don't genericize
- Add a proper introduction (the video likely starts mid-thought)
- Add a conclusion with a clear takeaway
- Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- Format code examples in code blocks
- Remove filler words ("um", "you know", "like") but preserve informal tone where it's intentional

**C. 3 Short-Form Clips (60-90 seconds each)**
For each clip:
1. Timestamp range from the transcript (e.g., 14:22 - 15:45)
2. The verbatim quote for the clip
3. Why this works as a standalone clip
4. Suggested caption/hook text for the clip post

**D. 5 Standalone Pull Quotes**
Shareable sentences that work without context. For use as image-text posts.

**E. Meta Description** (for the blog post)
Max 155 characters. Include the primary keyword: [YOUR PRIMARY KEYWORD]

## Sample Output

**Source:** 45-minute tutorial on "Building RAG pipelines with LlamaIndex"

**Chapter markers (excerpt):**
```
00:00 Introduction
02:15 What is RAG and why it matters
07:40 Setting up LlamaIndex
14:22 Chunking strategies: fixed vs semantic
23:10 Connecting to Qdrant vector DB
31:05 Hybrid search setup
38:45 Serving as a FastAPI endpoint
43:20 Common mistakes and how to fix them
```

**Short clip pick:**
```
Timestamp: 14:22 - 15:45
Quote: "Fixed-size chunking is like cutting a book into equal-length pieces
        regardless of where the chapters are. You end up with chunks that
        start mid-sentence and end mid-idea. Semantic chunking finds the
        natural breaks — it splits where the meaning actually changes."
Why it works: Complete standalone insight, no context needed, solves a
              specific misconception, quotable length.
Hook text: "Your RAG pipeline is probably chunking wrong. Here's why. 🧵"
```

> **What you get from Step 2:** Text-based deliverables (blog post, chapter markers, pull quotes). The clip timestamps tell you *where* and *what* to extract, but you still need to actually edit the video file.

---

## Step 3: Edit Video Clips (Manual Video Extraction)

Once you have the clip timestamps from Step 2, extract and edit the actual video files:

### With Descript (recommended for precision)
1. Import the video into [Descript](https://www.descript.com)
2. Descript auto-transcribes and shows you the transcript alongside the timeline
3. Find your clip timestamps, highlight the words, hit "Remove from Project" for everything outside
4. Export as MP4

### With CapCut (better for Reels/TikTok styling)
1. Import clip into [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com)
2. Add auto-captions (CapCut handles this well)
3. Apply B-roll, text overlays, or transitions
4. Export at 9:16 for Reels/TikTok, 16:9 for YouTube

## Automating the Pipeline

With n8n, you can fully automate: new YouTube upload → download audio → Whisper transcription → Claude content generation → save to Notion + schedule in Buffer.

See [n8n YouTube automation templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/?categories=marketing) for pre-built starting points.

## Validation

- Last reviewed: 2026-03-28
- Tested flag in repo: true
- This revision checked the structure, links, and step order against the sources below. Re-run the workflow in your own stack before relying on exact UI labels, pricing, or model behavior.

## Failure modes

- **Auto-transcription errors on technical terms:** Whisper doesn't always handle domain-specific vocab (library names, acronyms). Do a search-replace pass before sending to Claude.
- **Crosstalk in interviews/podcasts:** Whisper attribute speech to one speaker at a time. Diarization (speaker separation) requires additional tools like [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio).
- **Blog posts from transcripts need editing:** Spoken language has filler and repetition that survives even a good cleanup prompt. Plan for a 20-minute edit pass.
- **Short clips need visual context:** The Claude-generated clip script is excellent but the visual edit is still manual — the transcript alone doesn't tell you if the speaker is drawing a diagram at that moment.
